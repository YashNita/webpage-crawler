## Disclaimer
This program lets you download  and crawl tons of web pages. Please do not download and crawl any pages of a domain without reading about the robot.txt file of that domain. It is inappropriate to violate the robot.txt file. This may even lead to the domain completely blocking your crawler and thus blacklisting it. It is also not appropriate to crawl pages at high rate as it may put a lot of pressure on the server.
